NFT STAKING is coming to the world of BlockMonsters! 

As mentioned earlier we will make an official statement about the NFT Staking. We are working overtime right now, we are almost living on only Energy Drinks right now (Sugarfree), to get NFT Staking done.

Soon it will be possible to send your Blockmons out for staking and believe us, we will give them an amazing time in our NFT Staking contract. They will be treated super nicely there with a daily massage from @Dansteely and Jaguar and unlimited Blockmon Snacks.

The Blockmons which will be staked will collect $MNSTRS as a reward to their trainer and next to the $MNSTRS they will also get stronger by collecting these $MNSTRS. What does this mean? This means that all staked NFTs will also get EXP for getting staked!

So when do you expect to have NFT Staking ready?
Our estimated date for NFT Staking is the 8th of November. WAIT THAT'S NEXT WEEK!
